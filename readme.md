##SWOT

##Strengths
- 9 figure userbase
- So far the godfather (and only serious competitor) of professional social networks
- Replaces practical things (rolodex, resume) with digital solutions
- Allows user to easily keep track of colleagues as they make career moves
- Well-received longform content from "influencers"
- Insights and further insights with premium

###Weaknesses
- Business model
    + If premium works well, it has a short lifespan
    + Trying to be too many companies
- Self-defeating protocol
    + Mission to connect professionals
    + Protocol to prevent people from connecting unless they already know each other well or have done business together.
- So many options organized poorly keeps users from ever really understanding how to use LinkedIn

###Opportunities
- Create a better UX through UI changes
    + organize content more intuitively (like with like)
    + create more whitespace clear paths (too many options on every page right now).
    + Explain what things do as you do them (hover states, for examples)
- Open API and monetize
    + Get LinkedIn engrained in the structure of the internet a la Facebook and reap benefits
    + Use mountains of data to help others create powerful tools to help meet demand for jobs
- Create more actionable content
    + Right now its very broad
    + Written by ghosts
    + Feels good but without substance

###Threats
- Someone creating a professional social network that gets more results
- Someone creating a professional social network that has focus and knows what its doing
- Someone creating a professional social network that has an open API and beating LinkedIn to becoming part of the DNA of the internet



##User Testing

**Hypothesis**
I hypothesize users will have a difficult time editing what is publicly visible on their profiles because the "manage public profile" options is not given a prominent place, but is the last link in a dropdown menu.

**Test**
- User hovered in many places, unsure of where to go
- User went to privacy settings
- User changed visibility of activity feed
- User went back to profile, hovered
- User went back to privacy settings, scanned every line of small-text links in a list (not easy to find info quickly)
- User discovered "edit profile picture and visibility"
- User saw page that appeared to be where she started
- Made loop again
- User this time that in the sidebar there was a checklist for visibility options and changed/saved that

The process to change public visibility on a LinkedIn profile took my user 7 minutes.

Fun quotes from this test:

>It shouldn't be this hard.

>Gaaah, go away!

(Said about prompts to complete profile.)

##Notes
LinkedIn News on Google is a mixture of "How to use" and "How LinkedIn is failing"

**Mission**
>“to connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful”

**Reality**
>In reality, though, the job seeker tends to experience the insular world of LinkedIn connectivity as an irksome ritual of digital badgering. Instead of facing the prospect of interfacing professionally with a nine-figure user base with a renewed spring in their step, harried victims of economic redundancy are more likely to greet their latest LinkedIn updates with a muttered variation of, “Oh shit, I’d better send out some more résumés.” At which point, they’ll typically mark the noisome email nudge as “read” and relegate it to the trash folder.

>LinkedIn merely digitizes the core, and frequently cruel, paradox of networking events and conferences. You show up at such gatherings because you want to know more important people in your line of work—but the only people mingling are those who, like you, don’t seem to know anyone important. You just end up talking to the sad sacks you already know.

**Frustrations**
- This is supposed to help professionals connect, but LinkedIn makes it hard to connect with anyone you don't already know well. This neuters the usefulness of the platform for those looking for jobs.
- Oversimplification and unrealistic expectations
    + Listicle example
    + Dale Carnegie Example

**Strengths**
- Free to attend the party
- Sometimes recruiters DO troll the site

Stock Plunging

**Frustrations**
Barclays' Vogel seems to think it's a little of both. At one point Vogel compares LinkedIn to Zynga and Pandora in terms of how many of its freebie job-seeker users it can successfully convert to a premium account.

>"If it is truly good at helping a user find a job, subscribers will churn faster the more successful the application becomes."

>Of course, it’s no surprise that the tech world blames product design and network effects and the large financial institutions chalk it up to “mis-execution.”

>LinkedIn has become a jack of all trades and a master of none.

>LinkedIn needs to focus on what it does well and revive its social network business model to stimulate growth. That starts with selling ads and recruiting solutions — the core of LinkedIn’s business.

**Solutions**
- Open API and monetize
- Become a social network that helps recruiters find people in high-demand talent pools
